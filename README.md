**Welcome to AI Zero One 🤖**

**AI Zero One Logo ( I am working on this one :) )**

Ever thought AI was only for geniuses and robots? Me too!
So here's the deal: I'm diving headfirst into AI and Data Science.
Spoiler alert—I have no clue what I'm doing!
But hey, if I can figure some of this out, so can you.
I am getting my hands dirty, one fall or fail at a time.
I am buckled up for a rollercoaster of facepalms, high-fives, and daily logs where I mostly learn what not to do!
Just a lot of fumbling through code and celebrating the small wins.
Who knows, I might even make this AI thing look easy (eventually)!
